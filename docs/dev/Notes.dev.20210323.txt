processE runs in 
def sentryScheduler(db_store, gDict, interval):

    pe = processE(gDict, eDict, expire=30)

def processE(gDict, eDict, expire=864000): # i exist to expire

            #KR
            #no rulesDict, pull/extract expire from json here
            #json has "expire":"3600"?

i've added "expire":"3600" to 
def updategDictR(_key, gDict, rule_hit, r, line, rulesDct, db_store,  verbose=False):
so, gDict (prometheus data structure) now has ,expire="None",date="2021-03-23 09:22:09"} 2'

pass rulesDict to processE? no

parse gDict (prometheus data structure) for expire...
