reload rules (re-read?) on the fly

the idea is to be able to feed, change, add rules to the rule engine,
that i can later have another process do (sklearn)

automatically, smoothly...

first approach was to stop/terminate the loop, but that entails stopping/terminating the subprocess attached to syslog

review 'import this'

instead of terminate process...
  X (don't do) 1. could load rules each line (hit performance)
  Y (yes)      2. check after time, load if diff

i don't want any performance hit.  thats why the rules are loaded into memory first and then compared to each passing line, as opposed to loading rules each time a line passes.

how to check if diff, len(dictObj).  but the len could remain the same if rule 3 of len() 4 changes...  fingerprint the data?

i want it to first check diff based on time.  
  ...so, every 10 seconds check if reload needed

done.  - time-based (30s) check if dict is diff, if so reload.
