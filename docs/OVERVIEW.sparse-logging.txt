Sentinel - Distributed Systems Sparse Logging (Expert Rules with SysLog Data)

Provides a view of multiple logging systems without centralized or aggregated syslog data.  By leveraging Prometheus.io monitoring and alerting toolkit, expert rules can be applied in a sparse manner to search and identify domain specific knowledge and data.

Syslog Data.
SysLog (System Logging) data accumulates and consumes storage.  Configuring sparse logging is a mechanism that enables logging and alerting at the host without the need to save or aggregate system logs.  Sentinel logstream is a process that attaches to the system's syslog facility as JSON data.  Each line of syslog data is then passed through the rule engine.

Prometheus integration.
All data is presented in prometheus format.  Rules that yield a result are consumed (scraped) by prometheus.  




Fingerprint data


Logging and alerting can be configured for isolated PCI and multi-layered SOC2 environments.
